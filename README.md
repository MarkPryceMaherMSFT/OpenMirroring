# Open Mirroring
Project for open sources demos/proof of concepts for Mirroring different sources using Open Mirroing.

They show how easily you can setup Open Mirroring for yourself.   But just like any good demo/POC - it has code in it that is only there to expedite the development process (we call it tech debt) and need to be rewritten, before you put this anyone where a production scenario. 
I will draw your attention to the file upload process, I just use AZCOPY because it worked, I spent a few hours trying to get uploading a file to Onelake working and I failed.    So I found a solution hat worked so I could move on and write the rest of the code.

So if you feel like critising, I suggest you fix the issue first, submit a PR, then I'm more than happy to listen to the critisims of the coding. (The last time, I worked as a dev was back in the .Net 2.0 days - and I'm no longer a dev, so that should tell you something :-) )
